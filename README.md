# React + Vite

# Greeting Cards Application

A React application built using Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS to practice creating components and passing props. The application displays a header and three greeting cards, each with a title and message, demonstrating component structure, prop passing, and styling with Tailwind CSS.

## Project Overview**

This project involves creating a simple "Greeting Cards" app using React and Vite. The primary objective was to practice the following:

- Setting up a React application with Vite.
- Creating functional components and passing props to display dynamic content.
- Styling components effectively using Tailwind CSS.

By working through this project, I gained hands-on experience in React, including component creation, prop management, and styling. I also learned how to set up a React project with Vite and Tailwind CSS, streamlining the development process and improving performance.

## Discussion

Working on this project was a great way to solidify my understanding of React components and how to use props for passing dynamic data. Setting up the application with Vite was quick and efficient, and Tailwind CSS made it easy to apply consistent styling across components.

I found it particularly helpful to focus on breaking the app into small, reusable components. This approach not only made the code easier to manage but also enhanced my understanding of React’s component-driven architecture.
